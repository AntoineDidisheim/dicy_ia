TODO on the history of cards:
prepare them as good input as the number of cards fallen of each:
1  1
2  1
3  3
...
12 0

so it has a fixed size

Betting and following input:
[cards history] [Dice Value] [score in hand]

Card chosing:
[cards history] [cards in hand] [Dice] [predicted_value from betting and following]

latter on might add:
history of adversarial fold
